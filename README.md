This is a project from my Computer Architecture class that writes a rectangular prism with a yellow background to a bitmap display. This was created
and ran through a MARS simulator and written in MIPS.

The link to download the simulator is [here](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).

Feel free to test and run the code. This can be done by saving the file, clicking assemble, then "Tools", and Bitmap Display. From there, click
on "Connect MIPS" and then run the code. You should see the rectangular prism being written over a yellow background with the dimensions written
in the .data portion of the code.
